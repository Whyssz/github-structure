## Practice based on real technical tasks 

In these projects, I consolidate practical JavaScript skills before I start working with React, and I also plan to form a pet project: ["Quiz questions"](#) 

* `module learn` - experiment in JavaScript
* `module practic` - folder with ready-made solutions parsing projects  
* `own-pet` - my own projects, completed tasks you liked, or made from scratch
