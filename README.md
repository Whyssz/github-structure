## Info

The main purpose of this project (repository) is to collect in one place all the things I do (link or files themselves), what is in development/plans or scheme showing what is important

* `module learn` - the place where I try something new or save something for myself
* `module practic` - projects made in the course of training (training, not pet)
* `react` - rect projects and different test interactions

## Pet - easy to view
